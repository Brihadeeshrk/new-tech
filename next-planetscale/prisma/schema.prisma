// Referential integrity is a property of a data set that states that all its references are valid. 
// Referential integrity requires that if one record references another, then the referenced record must exist
// For example, if a Post model defines an author, then the author must also exist.

  provider             = "mysql"
  url                  = env("DATABASE_URL")

}

// planetscale doesnt support foreign key constraints
// and prisma defaults to using FK's to express relations among models
// so we need to set the referentialIntegrity even though its deprecated when using Prisma with PlanetScale
